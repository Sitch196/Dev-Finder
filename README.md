Simple Dev finder , it lets you find developer using their gitHub name and with given link you can easily check them out


I've used vite with typescript for creating this project , dev finder makes API call to one of the famous Puplic api 's to render developer information on the page .
for styling i used styled-components and icons are from font-awesome library
